# cs50Solutions
I am going to re-upload all of the solutions since this is my second time using this course
Honestly the first time I was always looking for the code online.
But now that I have more experience I will try to solve them on my own.

In pset1 i made the error when naming the files, it should be .c not .cpp.

Just finished pset2, it tooke me around 3 days to complete substitution, although I think it was more simple than caesar, the logic behind it was far more complex and it needed a more thinking, also they do not explain how to enchipher the text as in caesar :`v.

Pset3 was alright, until I arrive to tideman. I could not finish it because for it was impossible for me. I could not do the last two methods since I could not understand completely how the lock function works. After working on it for 1 week and a half, I have decided to continue the course and I will comeback to it when I have more experience. Tideman sucks, plurality and runoff were alright.
