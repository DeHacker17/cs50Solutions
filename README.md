# cs50Solutions
I am going to re-upload all of the solutions since this is my second time using this course
Honestly the first time I was always looking for the code online.
But now that I have more experience I will try to solve them on my own.

In pset1 i made the error when naming the files, it should be .c not .cpp.

Just finished pset2, it tooke me around 3 days to complete substitution, although I think it was more simple the logic behind it was far more complex and it needed a more thinking.
